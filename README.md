# Readme

Original repo by [JJGO](https://github.com/JJGO/macOS-setup)
The repository contains the files I use to configure a new installation of OS X/macOS to my liking

Most of the information was obtained through one or more sources in `reference.md`

# Installation
* Go over `manual.md` first
* Run `setup.sh`
